This document contains various recommendations and ideas based on experiences 
that the 2018-2019 ASU Capstone Team experienced during the semester.

These are ideas that the team did not have time to fully flesh out or
were outside of the scope for the current team.

1. Get a hold of or design low cost sensors designed for SolarSENSE
	- Existing sensors tend to be too expensive, are not accurate
	  enough, or do not give all of the data we would like.
	- During our travels in Hawaii, it was noted by farmers at
	  Mao Farms that being able to read PH levels would be useful.
2. Curate Digital Library for designated regions
	- This part of the system will likely be done outside of the
	  software development team, however this portion is also
	  vital to the success of the project, so it should be noted.
3. Add localization support
	- Add support to easily use content for other regions.
	- This includes both the Digital Library Content and
	  SolarSENSE's interface.
	- This product will likely by deployed in many very
	  different regions, so a feature like this is vital.
4. Improve user interface look and feel
	- One of the original constraints of the project was
	  to create an interface that is intuitive and easy
	  to use. This also includes limiting how much text
	  is used within the application.
	- This also includes refining the overall look and feel
	  of the user interface.
5. Do more on the field testing
	- This proved to be the most important aspect for our
	  learning process in attempting to create a useful product.
	- This includes both testing the system in real fields and
	  communicating with real farmers to determine what is useful.
